The Discourse Elements Ontology is an ontology for describing the major rhetorical elements of a document such as a journal article. It is a subsidiary ontology that is imported into the Document Components Ontology, itself part of SPAR, the Semantic Publishing and Referencing Ontologies. Other SPAR ontologies are described at http://purl.org/spar/.
